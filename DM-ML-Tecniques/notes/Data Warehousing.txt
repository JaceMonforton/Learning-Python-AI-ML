What is Data Warehousing?
    - Large Database that conatins info from many sources
    - Queried via SQL or Tableau

    ETL: Extract, Transform, Load:
        - Raw data from Operational systems is periodically extracted,
        - Data is Transformed into the schema needed by the Data Warehouse
        - Data is loaded into the data Warehouse, already in the needed structure

        - When dealing with Big Data, the Transform step can ben issue.

    ELT: Extract, Load, Transform
        - Things like hive let you host massive databases on a Hadoop cluster.
        - The Scalibility of Hadoop lets you flip the loading process
            Process:
                - Extract Data as before
                - Load it in as-is
                - Use Hadoop to transform it in place.
