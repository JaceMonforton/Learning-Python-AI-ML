    Reduce high dimensional info into lower dimensional info (compact and preserve variance)
    compression / feature extraction
        Ex: K-Means Clustering
            - Reduces data into K dimensions.

    PCA: Principal Component Analysis
        - Finds Eigenvectors in the higher dimensional data while preserving the variance
        - the data gets projected onto these hyper planes which represent the lower dimensions you want to represent.
            -Popular Implimentation:
                - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
        - Useful for image compression and facial recognition

Example: Visualizing 4-D Iris Flower data
    - Has Petals and Sepals
    - Know Length and width of the petals and sepals for many iris'
        - Four dimensions
    - Also Know the subspecies classification of each flower.
