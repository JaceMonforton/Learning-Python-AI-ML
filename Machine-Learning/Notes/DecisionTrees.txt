Decision Trees:
    Flowchart of how to make a decision - Another form of supervised learning.

    Example:
        Build a system to filter out resumes based on historical hiring data

        1. You have databased of some important attributes of job candidates, and you know whyuch ones were hireed and which ones werent.
        2. Train decision tree on that data

            - Greedy Algorithm (Dijktstra or Prim's/Krushkal's )
                - Picks option that reduces entropy the most at that stage.

    Prone to Overfitting , construct sevral alternate decision trees and let them "vote" on the final classification
        - Randomly resample data for each tree: "Bootstrap Aggregating or bagging"
        - Randomize a subset of attributes each step is allowed to chose from. 
    Ensemble learning.
