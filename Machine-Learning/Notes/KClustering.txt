K-Clustering
Attempts to split data into K groups that are closest to K centroids.

Unsupervised Learning - uses only the position of each data position- can uncover interesting rouping of people / things / behavious

Ex: Where do millionaires live? 
Ex: What genre of music / movie?

K-Means Clustering:
- 1. Pick 'K'centroids (k-means)
- 2. Assiogn each data point ot rthe centroid its closest to
- 3. Recompute the centroids based on the average position of each centroid's points
- 4. Iterate until points stop changing assignments to centroids

1. Choosing K:
    - Increase K values until you stop getting large reductions in squared error
2. Avoid Local Minima:
    - The random choice of initial centroids can yield different results 
    - Run it a few times to ensure your initial results arent wacky.
3. Labeling Clusters:
    - K-means does not attemp to assign any meaning to the clusters you find
    - we must dig up data and determine it.
