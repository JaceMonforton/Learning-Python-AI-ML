Support Vector Machines:
    - Works well for classifying high dimensional data (lots of features)
    - Finds higher dimensional support vectors across which to divide the data

High Dimensions, Hyper Planes, Etc:
    - SVM's Employ advanced mathematical trickery to cluster data, can handle data sets with lots of features.
    - Fairly Expensive, the 'Kernel Trick" is the only thing that makes it possible.
    - Supervised Learning.

Support Vector Classification:
    - Use Different Kernels with SVC, some will work better than others in a given data set.
