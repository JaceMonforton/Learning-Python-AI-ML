UnSupervised:
    - Not giving answers to learn from, giving data and it tries to make sense of it given no info
    - ex: given objects: square, circle, cube, rectangle, etc, algorithm clusters objects into things that are similar, ex: color, shape, # of sides, etc
    - no set of answers to learn from, gathers own answers given data
    - Latent vairable:
        - You dont know what youre looking for

    Ex: Clustering users on a dating website based on their info and preferences
    Ex: Clustering of movies based on properties
    Ex: Analyze the Text of a product description to find the terms that carry the most meaning for a ceetain category

Supervised Learning:
    - Have set of answers that model can learn from
    - given training data that the model learns from it can infer relationships between feastures and categories we want and apply that to unseen, new values 
    -training model using actual answers.

    Ex: Train a model for predicting car prices based on car attributes using historical sales data. Model can then predict the optimal price for the new car that hasnt been sold before.

Evaluating Supervised Learning:
    - Train/Test
    - Build Model using subset of data for training data and evaluate model that comes out to see if it can successfully predict for the testing data.
    - Portion of data for testing that was generated using the training set. - concrete way to test model 
    - Measure using r-squared (accuracy) to test best model., tune paramters, 

Train / Test In Practice:
- Its Not perfect
    - Need to ensure both sets are large enough to contain representatives of all the variation and outliers in the data you care about.
    - The Data sets must be selected randomly
    - Great way to guard against overfitting
    - Samples sizes too small

K-Fold Cross Validation:
    - Train/Test Multiple times.
    - Multiple randomly assigned segments (k-segments)
        - reserve one as test data
    -Train on each of the remaining segments and measure perfomance against the test set
    -Take average r-squared scores from each results.
