XGBoost:
    - eXtreme Gradient Boosted Trees.
        - Boosted is an Ensemble Method.
            - Each Tree boosts attributes that led to mis-classification of a previous tree

 - Features:
    - Regularized Boosting (Prevents Overfitting)
    - Can Handle missing values automatically 
    - Parallel Processing
    - Can Cross Validate at each iteration:
        - Enables early stopping, finding optimal number of iterations.
    - Incremental training
    - Can plug in your own optimization objectives.
    - Tree Pruning:
        - Generally results in deeper, but optimized trees.
